Answers to code-reading questions:

1. The "magic numbers" are a subset of the numbers that can appear in the
   e_ident property of the elf header. They represent the characters in the
   name "ELF."

2. UIO_USERISPACE is used for user-created executable code, whereas
   UIO_USERSPACE is used for user-created data.  UIO_SYSSPACE should only be
   used to transfer data to and from the kernel.

3. Because the uio also holds the virtual memory space the file was read to.

4. Files should always be closed when they're not being used so other programs
   can have access to them.

5. mips_usermode in trap.c; it is not machine-dependent

6. Copyin and Copyout are defined in copyinout.c, while memmove is defined in
   memmove.c.  They cannot be implemented as simply because they have to
   cross the boundry between kernel space and user space.

7. It points to the address space availible for the user.

8. 8

9. To restore the previous spl once the function finishes its work.

10. 4

11. Because it doesn't have the code to actually kill the thread.

12. You would have to use a pointer *args to point to where the extra arguments
    are.

13. To simplify the process of making a system call.

14. syscall
