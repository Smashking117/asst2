1.  The threads attributes are changed to Null and it is transformed into a
    zombie; eventually it will be destroyed when exorcise() is called.

2.  mi_switch() and thread_yield().

3.  RUN means that it's running, READY means that it can start running at any
    time, SLEEP means that it's suspended while the CPU works on other threads,
    and ZOMB means that it's supposed to be destroyed but hasn't been yet.

4.  Turning interrupts off prevents a thread from being interrupted during its
    actions.  It is accomplished with splhigh().  It is important because the
    thread sometimes need to perform certain actions atomically.

5.  It removes the thread from the list of sleepers and makes it runnable.
    A sleeping thread can run again when thread_wakeup() and mi_threadstart()
    are called on it.

6.  scheduler()

7.  It chooses the next thread in the runqueue

8.  The timer controls how much time must pass before control is changed to a
    different thread.  A timer interrupt causes thread_wakeup() to be called.

9.  thread_sleep() is used to prevent threads from running when the count is
    zero, while thread_wake() will wake up a thread when the count is
    incremented.  The argument switches the context to the semaphore.

10. Because if the thread isn't the holder, then it shouldn't run.
