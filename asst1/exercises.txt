1. It would be implemented using a lock that is passed through a queue
   containing the cars in the order of their arrival.  It is suboptimal because
   it doesn't consider situations where cars can both go through the
   intersection at the same time without hitting each other, and it doesn't
   take the relative speeds of the vehicles into account.

2. All of the quarters being occupied at once would cause deadlock, since
   no one would be able to move without causing an accident.
